**JCROM** (pronounced "Jack-rom") stands for Java Content Repository Object Mapper. It is a lightweight framework for mapping Java objects to/from a Java Content Repository (JCR). This is commonly called Object Content Mapping.

JCROM relies on annotations only, so there are no XML configuration files involved.

JCROM ensures that your objects are mapped to the JCR according to best practices, meanwhile abstracting the gritty details and making your code clean and readable.

  * annotation based (needs Java 1.5)
  * lightweight, minimal external [dependencies](Dependencies.md)
  * simple to learn, easy to use (and test)
  * removes error prone boiler plate code
  * works with any JCR implementation
  * works well with [Guice](UsingWithGuice.md) and [Spring](UsingWithSpring.md)
  * vision: do for JCR what Hibernate did for JDBC

You can look at the [documentation](UserGuide.md) for more explanations.
