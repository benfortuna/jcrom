= JavaFX properties support =

Since release 2.2.0, JCROM supports JavaFX properties, to map Java objects with JavaFX properties directly to/from a JCR repository.

JCROM checks whether the JavaFX jar is present in the classpath. If found, JCROM allows to use the JavaFX properties.

This integration was carried out thanks to the work of Antoine Mischler who developed jcromfx, a JCROM fork with JavaFX support: https://github.com/dooApp/jcromfx
