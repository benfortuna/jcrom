# Release 1.1 (23.02.2008) #

Some bugfixes, but also enhancements such as support for references, and versioning support in the DAO classes. There is a bit of broken backwards compatibility. It is now mandatory to have a @JcrPath annotated field. Also, in the DAO classes: name-based methods are now path-based, and because of the removal of the static root path, the finder methods and the AbstractJcrDAO constructors have changed.
